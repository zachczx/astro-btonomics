I cleaned out the cabinet under my kitchen sink recently. It's often damp there because of water and detergent spills. I found a lot of mold.

I don't think of cleaning it actually. But coincidentally I was looking for some stuff and saw tons of white stuff. So I took everything out, cleared out the cabinet.

## The Damage

This was the cabinet before I cleaned it.

This definitely wasn't healthy! Especially for an adult with respiratory issues and a kid with eczema.

So it was up to Magiclean bleach and scrubbing.

## Warning

But before that, a PSA: CDC says that people with allergies, lung disease, immuno-compromised, or have respiratory diseases shouldn't clean mold. I wore a standard surgical mask but it wouldn't have been effective anyway, you'd need an N95 mask for mold.

## After Cleaning

And it's really difficult to reach all the corners, almost missed stuff out. So check with a phone with flashlight and take pictures of tight corners.

I don't know how long the mold was there. It probably was there for a long time. We don't wet it intentionally, but probably worth putting a Thirsty Hippo in future.

After the cleaning, we made sure to leave the cabinet doors open for a couple of days. It didn't hurt.
